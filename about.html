                <h2>About NWDOH Pharmaceutical and Surgical Stock Status</h2>
                <p>Efficient stock management is crucial in ensuring continuous healthcare services. The <strong>NWDOH
                        Pharmaceutical and Surgical Stock Status</strong> platform was developed to provide real-time
                    insights into stock levels across hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies in South Africa. This
                    initiative enhances supply chain transparency, reduces shortages, and ensures that essential
                    medicines and surgical items are always available where they are needed most.</p>
