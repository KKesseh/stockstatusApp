        <h2>List of DDV - Direct Delivery Items</h2>
        <p>
            DDV (Direct Delivery) Items: DDV items are products that are not stored at the medical warehouse but are
            instead directly delivered from the supplier to the healthcare facility. Facilities place their orders with
            the medical stores, which then processes the order and communicates with the supplier to arrange delivery.
            This method allows for specialized items or products that are not typically stocked to be delivered directly
            to the facility from the company.
        </p>
